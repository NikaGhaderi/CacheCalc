# CacheCalc: A Direct-Mapped Cache Arithmetic Unit Simulator

## Overview
CacheCalc is a simulation of a simple arithmetic unit that utilizes a direct-mapped cache to efficiently process commands and perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction. The project is designed to demonstrate the interaction between main memory, cache memory, and an arithmetic unit, providing insights into how caching mechanisms can enhance computational efficiency.
